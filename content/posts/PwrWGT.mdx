### Easy Vegan Tofu Stir Fry Recipe

#### Ingredients:

- 1 block of firm tofu, drained and pressed
- 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil
- 1 onion, sliced
- 3 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 bell pepper, sliced
- 1 cup of broccoli florets
- 1 cup of sliced mushrooms
- 1/4 cup of soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons of cornstarch
- 1 tablespoon of rice vinegar
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- Red chili flakes (optional)

#### Instructions:

1. Start by pressing the tofu to remove excess moisture. Wrap it in a clean kitchen towel or paper towels, place a heavy object on top, and let it sit for at least 30 minutes.

2. Cut the tofu into cubes and set them aside.

3. Heat the vegetable oil in a large pan or wok over medium-high heat. Add the sliced onions and cook until they turn translucent, about 5 minutes.

4. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute, stirring constantly to prevent burning.

5. Add the sliced bell pepper, broccoli florets, and mushrooms to the pan. Cook for about 5-7 minutes or until the vegetables are tender but still crisp.

6. In a small bowl, mix together the soy sauce, cornstarch, rice vinegar, salt, black pepper, and red chili flakes (if using).

7. Add the tofu cubes to the pan with the vegetables and pour the soy sauce mixture over everything. Mix well to ensure all ingredients are coated in the sauce.

8. Cook for another 3-5 minutes or until the sauce has thickened and the tofu is heated through. Stir frequently to prevent sticking.

9. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. Serve hot with rice, noodles, or your favorite accompaniment.

Enjoy your easy vegan tofu stir fry!
