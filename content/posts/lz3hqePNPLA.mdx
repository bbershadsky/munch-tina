# Pork Knuckle Recipe

Ingredients:

- 1 pork knuckle
- 1/2 onion, cubed
- Sichuan peppercorns
- Aniseed
- Cinnamon
- Black pepper
- Bay leaves
- Ginger slices
- Garlic slices
- 2 scallions
- Oil
- Salt (to taste)
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
- Huadiao cooking wine
- Rock sugar
- Smoked paprika (optional)

Instructions:

1. Soak the pork knuckle in cold water for about two hours, adding a little white vinegar to remove any fishy smell.
2. Prepare the seasonings and ingredients: half an onion, cubed; Sichuan peppercorns, aniseed, cinnamon, black pepper, bay leaves, ginger slices, garlic slices, and two scallions.
3. Wash and dry the pork knuckle, then use a knife to enhance the flavor by making staggered cuts instead of circular ones. This will help prevent the skin from falling off during cooking.
4. Heat a wok over high heat and add oil. Stir-fry Sichuan peppercorns, aniseed, cinnamon, and black pepper until fragrant.
5. Add onions, ginger, and garlic, then stir-fry until fragrant.
6. Before stewing the meat, stir-fry the seasonings and ingredients instead of directly adding them to the soup. This step is important for enhancing flavor.
7. Fry a few bay leaves and add salt according to your taste preference.
8. Season with soy sauce and dark soy sauce after stir-frying at high temperature.
9. Add hot water or stock, ensuring the amount is roughly equal to the length of the pork knuckle. Also, add one tablespoon of Huadiao cooking wine and a few more bay leaves.
10. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to low and let it simmer for two hours while keeping slightly open. Flip the pork knuckle occasionally to prevent the skin from sticking to the bottom of the pot.
11. If you prefer a reduced soup at the end, omit this stewing step and proceed directly to baking.
12. After two hours of cooking, take out the pork knuckle and brush oil on its surface. Sprinkle an appropriate amount of pepper on all sides.
13. Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius). Place the pork knuckle on a baking sheet lined with tin foil, sprinkle a little salt, and bake for 20 minutes. For a crispy effect, bake for 30 minutes.
14. Stew until cooked and then bake. This will result in flavorful meat inside with a delicious aroma from the barbecued outer skin of the bone.

Enjoy your European-style braised pork knuckle!
