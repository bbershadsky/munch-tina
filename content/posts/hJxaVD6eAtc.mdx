  This Croissant recipe is about as minimal equipment as you can get in a recipe. It's a no machine, as well as a no knead recipe. All it requires is some focus, and a little bit of patience. Oh, and a rolling pin helps too. Then you end up with beautifully flakey and buttery croissants that have a glossy crispy exterior, and a soft and rich inside. Nothing beats homemade.

Certainly! Here's a summary of how to make croissants according to your recipe:

Ingredients:

- 400 g all-purpose flour
- 5 g salt
- 60 g sugar
- 20 g active dry yeast
- 375 ml cold water
- 500 g unsalted butter, chilled and divided into two portions

Instructions:

1. Combine the flour, salt, sugar, and yeast in a large mixing bowl. Mix well.
2. Gradually add the cold water while stirring until a shaggy dough forms.
3. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5 minutes or until it becomes smooth and elastic.
4. Shape the dough into a rough square, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least an hour.
5. Take one portion of the chilled butter (about 250 g) and roll it into a 10x8 inch rectangle between two sheets of parchment paper. Chill the remaining butter.
6. Roll out the dough into a 12x9 inch rectangle. Place the rolled-out butter in the center, then fold the corners of the dough over the butter to completely enclose it. Pinch the edges to seal.
7. Use a rolling pin to gently flatten the dough into a thick square. Roll out the dough into a 18x12 inch rectangle, being careful not to tear the delicate layers. Fold the bottom third of the dough up, then fold the top third down over it. This is called a "letter fold" or a single turn.
8. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
9. Repeat steps 6-8 two more times (for a total of three turns).
10. After the third turn, roll out the dough into a large rectangle, about 24x8 inches. This is the final letter fold. Fold the bottom third up, then fold the top third down over it. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or overnight.
11. Remove the chilled dough from the refrigerator and roll it out into a large rectangle, about 24x8 inches. Cut the dough into five equal triangles.
12. Gently elongate each triangle by about an inch, then tightly roll them up starting from the widest edge. Ensure that the tail of the triangle is facing down to prevent unraveling during baking. Place the croissants on a parchment-lined baking sheet with enough space between them.
13. Brush the tops of the croissants with egg wash (one whole egg whisked together). Cover the baking sheet with another inverted rimmed baking sheet to create an environment for proofing.
14. Proof the croissants at 78 degrees Fahrenheit for 2 hours. The croissants should look puffy, almost doubled in size, and jiggle slightly when shaken.
15. Preheat your oven to 390 degrees Fahrenheit (for convection ovens) or 400 degrees Fahrenheit (for non-convection ovens).
16. Bake the croissants for 6 minutes at 390 degrees Fahrenheit (or 15-20 minutes at 400 degrees Fahrenheit) or until golden brown and puffy.
17. Let the croissants cool before serving.

Enjoy your homemade croissants!
