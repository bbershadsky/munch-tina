### Homemade Tomato Soup Recipe

#### Ingredients:
- 2 lbs fresh tomatoes, chopped
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 2 cups chicken or vegetable broth
- 1 tsp sugar
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh basil or parsley for garnish (optional)

#### Instructions:

1. In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
2. Add the minced garlic to the pot and cook for an additional minute, stirring constantly to prevent burning.
3. Add the chopped tomatoes to the pot and mix well with the onion and garlic mixture. Cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes have released their juices.
4. Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth and add the sugar, salt, and pepper to taste. Stir well and bring the mixture to a simmer.
5. Reduce heat to low and let the soup simmer for about 20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.
6. Remove the pot from heat and use an immersion blender or carefully transfer the soup in batches to a blender to puree until smooth.
7. If the soup is too thick, you can thin it out with additional broth or water.
8. Serve hot, garnished with fresh basil or parsley if desired. Enjoy your delicious homemade tomato soup!
