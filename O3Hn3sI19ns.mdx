Title: Easy Chicken Stir Fry Recipe

Ingredients:
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, sliced into thin strips
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 onion, sliced
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced
- 1 green bell pepper, sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, grated
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1/4 cup water
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Cooked rice for serving

Instructions:

1. In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce and cornstarch. Add water and mix well. Set aside.
2. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add chicken strips and cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside.
3. In the same pan, add more oil if needed, then saut√© onion, bell peppers, garlic, and ginger for 4-5 minutes until they are tender but still crisp.
4. Return the cooked chicken to the pan with the vegetables, stirring to combine. Pour the soy sauce mixture over the chicken and vegetables. Stir well and cook for another 2-3 minutes until the sauce thickens.
5. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
6. Serve the chicken stir fry hot over cooked rice. Enjoy!
